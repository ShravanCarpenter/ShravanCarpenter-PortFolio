                        I am a final year IT student, passionate front-end developer who loves building interactive and user-friendly web applications.
                        I enjoy creating visually appealing and responsive designs that enhance user experiences. Bringing ideas to life through clean and efficient
                        code excites me, and I am always eager to explore new technologies to improve my development skills.

                    <p className="slide-in delay-1">
                        In addition to front-end development, I have a strong foundation in programming languages like C++, JavaScript, and React. I am well-versed
                        in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which helps me write optimized and scalable code.
                    </p>
                    <p className="slide-in delay-2">
                        I also have experience working with React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Git & Github, enabling me to develop full-stack applications efficiently.
                        Always eager to learn and grow, I strive to stay updated with the latest trends in web development.
